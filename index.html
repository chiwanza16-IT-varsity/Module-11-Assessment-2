                   Must-eat dish: Pizza margherita 
                 </strong> <br><br>

                  You can’t talk food in Italy without talking Naples – and you can’t talk food in Naples without talking pizza. A’ pizz was born in Naples in the nineteenth century as a quick, affordable meal for the city’s working classes, and old-school pizzerias (mostly centred around Via dei Tribunali, aka Pizza Street) continue to feed hungry Neapolitans today. While there are certainly elevated iterations around the city, it’s still the cheapest bite in Naples – locals named pizza a portafoglio the city’s best-value dish, a grab-and-go folded slice that costs around €1 a pop. And the proof is in the pie: Naples ranked as the most affordable city to eat out in our survey.

                  <strong>Why visit now</strong> ‘Neapolitan cuisine celebrates diversity, simplicity and the marriage between land, sea and history,’ says writer and Naples local Gabriela Proietti. ‘This rich food culture can be found everywhere in the city: it’s in the piping hot plates of pasta alla genovese and Neapolitan ragù, the morning sugar rush from <span class="text-danger">ricotta-filled sfogliatella or rum-soaked babà</span>, a stroll through the sixteenth-century Mercato della Pignasecca.

                  ‘The energetic Quartieri Spagnoli district is erupting as the place to be for food right now, but don’t settle for any open-air trattoria. For the city’s crowning dish, pizza margherita, head to <span class="text-danger">Santa Maradona,</span> where owner Andrea Viviani honours Naples’ most prized possessions: pizza, football, and Diego Armando Maradona.

                  </strong> <br><br>

                  Cape Town might steal the limelight for its international cuisine (and our newly opened <span class="text-danger">Time Out Market</span>, on the V&A Waterfront, is testament to the culinary talent in the Mother City), but Jo’burg is a worthy rival for the title of South Africa’s food capital. From Ethiopian cafes in Little Addis to Nigerian and West African eats in the south of the city, you can eat your way across the continent here – though the majority of locals we surveyed recommended the city’s traditional South African delicacies, like the Sowetan kota sandwich, bunny chow and mala mogodu. <br>

                  <strong>Why visit now</strong> ‘If Jo’burg is the soul of South Africa, Braamfontein is the pulse of the city. This central neighbourhood is home to some of my favourite places to eat, people-watch and dance, with some of the most innovative ventures combining the forces of food and culture,’ says Johannesburg food writer Thando Moleketi-Williams. ‘Head to <span class="text-danger">Mamakashaka and Friends</span> on De Beer Street for weekends of wine and hip hop, cocktails and playlists, a monthly book club and an exciting rotation of food collabs. A few blocks up on Reserve Street, <span class="text-danger">Artivist</span> is a restaurant and gallery space that’s recently launched a monthly fine dining Sunday brunch club residency by award-winning chef <span class="text-danger">Katlego Mlambo</span>. While you’re there, don’t miss speakeasy and live music space <span class="text-danger">Untitled Basement</span>.’

                   Must-east dish: Ceviche 
                  </strong> <br><br>
                  Lima is not only the culinary capital of <span class="text-danger">Peru</span>, but of the entire South American continent. It’s home to the ‘world’s best restaurant’ in <span class="text-danger">Central</span>, but you can sample the Peruvian flavours on Central’s ten-course tasting menu everywhere across the city (and for a fraction of the price). Tangy pisco sours, citrusy ceviche and lomo saltado (Peruvian beef stir fry) all got the nod from locals in our survey, but when it came to value, the simple, hearty arroz con pollo (chicken and rice) was named the city’s most affordable dish. <br>

                  <strong>Why visit now</strong> ‘Lima’s meteoric rise to leading culinary city was cemented last year when Central topped the world’s best restaurant list, throwing light on a country where ancient grains meet the fish-rich Humboldt Current and the culinary influences of Chinese and Japanese immigrant communities,’ says travel writer and Lima expert Steph Dyson. ‘The latter shaped Lima’s emblematic marinated fish dish, ceviche; you can sample it everywhere from five-star restaurants to portside markets, although my preference is at unpretentious <span class="text-danger">Punto Azul</span>. Limeño gastronomy is constantly evolving, too. Don’t miss <span class="text-danger">Mérito</span>, a lauded Venezuelan-Peruvian fusion restaurant where high Andean tubers and Venezuelan arepas meet.’

                    Must-eat dish: Pho Saigon
                  </strong> <br><br>
                  Sweet, spicy, fragrant, fishy – however you’d describe it, Vietnamese cuisine never compromises on flavour, and you can sample the very best of it in Ho Chi Minh. Beyond the streetside food stalls and bustling markets hawking banh mi, snails, broken rice and offal stew are a clutch of Bib Gourmand and Michelin-starred restaurants serving up creative renditions of classic dishes. But by far the most mentioned dish in our survey was pho. The warming noodle soup – in the south typically heavily garnished with basil, coriander, chilli and hoisin sauce – is a Vietnamese staple, ubiquitous across the city. <br>

                  <strong>Why visit now </strong> ‘Though <span class="text-danger">Hanoi</span> might be the birthplace of Vietnamese cuisine and culture, Ho Chi Minh has emerged as the country's most exciting dining destination,’ says Ho Chi Minh writer Dan Q Dao. ‘In District 1, the central downtown hub, there's <span class="text-danger">Ănăn Saigon</span>, chef Peter Cuong Franklin's ‘new Vietnamese’ restaurant that nabbed the city's sole Michelin star in last year's inaugural guide to Vietnam. It's within walking distance of <span class="text-danger">Bánh Mì Huỳnh Hoa</span>, a 30-year-old street food institution specialising in French-influenced Vietnamese baguette sandwiches, which originated in the city. Across the river in District 2 is a burgeoning modern restaurant landscape – the tasting menu concept <span class="text-danger">Tre Dining </span>and gastro-focused wine bar <span class="text-danger">Little Bear</span> stand out for their interpretation of Vietnamese ingredients and flavours through Western culinary techniques.’

                    Must-eat dish: Peking duck
                  </strong> <br><br>
                  Beijing is a city for carnivores. Asked which dish everyone should try when visiting their city, locals overwhelmingly put meat on the menu: gongbao chicken, hot pot, and (of course) peking duck were the most common answers. But veggies won’t be disappointed, either – stir-fried, steamed, spiced or parcelled in a dumpling, you can find the good stuff all over the Chinese capital. And while Beijing has its share of gourmet restaurants, the city’s many snack streets and night markets ensure eating out won’t cost a fortune – grab a jian bing (a Chinese savoury crepe) and a local beer and you’re set. <br>

                  <strong>Why visit now</strong> ‘Peking duck is the quintessential Beijing cuisine, and my go-to spot is <span class="text-danger">Siji Minfu</span>,’ says Wendy Xu, editor at Time Out Beijing. ‘It's not unheard of to wait more than an hour to be seated here, even when you book ahead, but their perfectly roasted ducks with crispy skin make waiting in line so worth it. If I'm looking for something a bit more fancy, I head to <span class="text-danger">Qu Lang Yuan</span>, where French-Chinese fusion cuisine shines with fresh local ingredients. For a true hole-in-the-wall experience, there's no better place than <span class="text-danger">Yudefu'</span>s lamb hotpot. For something new and delicious in the Jing, don't miss Puzzles and Greek Freak. Puzzles is a perfect sunshine brunch spot, featuring a European-inspired brunch menu, while Greek Freak is a go-to for authentic gyros and hummus.’
